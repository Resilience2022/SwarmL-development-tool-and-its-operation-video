# SwarmL-development-tool-and-its-operation-video
The repository contains a zip package of SwarmL development environment and the operation video of FDIBS APP development using SwarmL development environment.  
The SwarmL development environment installation package can be installed directly in Eclipse through the Xtext plug-in.
This video shows the steps of creating a new project, editing the program, and generating object code in SwarmL development environment.
Since the video file is too large, we cut the operation video into two parts.
